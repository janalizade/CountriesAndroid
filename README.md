"## Simple application  with complex context behind this , I enable nice functionality such as unit testing , I used Retrofit and Json to communicate with the backend to get the List of Countries.I used MVVM technology to separate between Model , View and BusinessLogic .I also used RXJAva inorder to make a nice separation between Retrofit and Model and other side of application and the business logic.I also used dependency Injection to further separation between business logic and other objects that I am using . I also make a unit testing to make sure that may application works nicely  "
